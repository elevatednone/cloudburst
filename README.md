The project aims to expose individuals and organizations capitalizing on public or freely available information by repackaging and reselling it under the guise of novelty or exclusive insight. Leveraging investigative methods and consultation with industry experts, we scrutinize the origins, authenticity, and contributory value of such information to discern its worth to the industry. Our objective is to protect the public from deceptive practices by making transparent the true sources of the information being sold, the quality of this information, and where it can be found for free and publicly. By shedding light on these practices, we hope to hold the grifters accountable, deter future fraudulent activities, and educate consumers about the importance of due diligence in the marketplace of ideas and information.

It has come to our attention that there is an alarmingly high amount of "information security experts" who are selling information that is neither novel nor practical in today's environments. It becomes increasingly frustrating that they oversaturate the market with frivolous and borderline archaic practices/techniques/methods that only serve to keep people operating below their potential. Whether intentional or not, it needs to be documented, as the public is owed transparency into the information that currently exists for free that these "instructors" try to sell for a little pat on the back and an ego boost.
